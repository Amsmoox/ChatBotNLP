<h1>ChatBotNLP (Demo Algorithm)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Development and Research of Software Components of Natural Language Processing for building an Intelligent Chatbot.<br>
This project explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its role in ChatBot development.<br>
We will focus on the use of Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), aiming to create an interactive and intuitive ChatBot that can:<br>
- understand and answer user questions;<br>
- improve human and computer communications.

<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b> Python </b>
- <b> Tkinter for graphical user interface </b>
- <b> Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries and tools, including NLTK </b>
- <b> Tokenization techniques for text processing </b>
- <b> scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms </b>
- <b> Libraries for handling text data and performing vectorization and cosine similarity calculations </b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Python programming environment</b>
- <b>Development environment with access to necessary libraries and packages for NLP and machine learning</b>
- <b>Environment capable of running Python scripts and applications, such as Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, or any Python-supported IDE.</b>

<h2>Testing ChatBot</h2>
